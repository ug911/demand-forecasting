# Forecasting Models

Demand forecasting is an essential part of business planning and decision-making, and various models are used to predict future demand based on historical data, trends, and other influencing factors. Here are some of the most famous demand forecasting models:

### **1. Time Series Models**
These models use historical data to predict future demand by identifying patterns, trends, and seasonality.

- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):** A popular statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It's effective for data with trends and seasonality when parameters are tuned correctly.
- **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA):** An extension of ARIMA that accounts for seasonal variations in data.
- **Exponential Smoothing (ETS):** A technique that gives more weight to recent observations, useful for data with trends and seasonality (e.g., Holt-Winters method).

### **2. Machine Learning Models**
Machine learning approaches are increasingly used for demand forecasting due to their ability to handle complex relationships and large datasets.

- **Random Forest:** A tree-based ensemble learning model suitable for capturing non-linear relationships in demand data.
- **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):** Effective for handling large-scale data and improving prediction accuracy.
- **Neural Networks:** Includes models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which are well-suited for time series data.

### **3. Causal Models**
These models examine relationships between demand and other influencing factors like price, advertising, or economic indicators.

- **Regression Analysis:** A statistical method to identify relationships between demand and independent variables.
- **Econometric Models:** Advanced regression models that incorporate economic theories and constraints.

### **4. Inventory-Based Models**
Used in supply chain management to balance demand with inventory levels.

- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):** A model for determining the optimal order quantity to minimize total inventory costs.
- **Newsvendor Model:** Used for short-lifecycle products to determine inventory levels under uncertainty.

---

### **5. Hybrid Models**
Combining different approaches to leverage the strengths of each.

- **Prophet by Facebook:** A hybrid model combining time series analysis with components for trend and seasonality, designed for business forecasting.
- **SARIMAX:** Extends SARIMA by adding external regressors to capture causal factors.

---

### **6. Judgmental and Qualitative Models**
Incorporate expert opinions and market insights, especially useful for new products or markets with limited data.

- **Delphi Method:** A structured communication technique where experts iteratively refine forecasts.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Creating different demand scenarios based on qualitative and quantitative inputs.

---

### **7. Simulation Models**
These models simulate real-world systems to predict demand under various conditions.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Uses random sampling and statistical modeling to estimate probabilities of different outcomes.
- **System Dynamics:** Simulates complex systems with feedback loops, such as supply chains.

---

### **8. Industry-Specific Models**
Tailored to address specific demand forecasting needs in industries like retail, manufacturing, and energy.

- **Demand Sensing:** A retail-focused approach using real-time data for short-term forecasting.
- **Load Forecasting Models:** Used in the energy sector to predict electricity demand.

### Selection Criteria:
The choice of the model depends on:
- **Data Availability:** Quantity, quality, and type of historical data.
- **Forecast Horizon:** Short-term, medium-term, or long-term forecasts.
- **Complexity vs. Accuracy:** Balancing simplicity with prediction accuracy.
- **Industry Requirements:** Specific needs of the business or sector.
