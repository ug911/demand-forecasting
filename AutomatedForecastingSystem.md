# Automated Demand Forecasting System
Designing a dynamic, self‐correcting demand forecasting system involves building a modular, scalable pipeline that continuously learns from new data and picks the best forecasting model for each SKU. Here’s a simplified end-to-end workflow:

1. **Daily Data Ingestion:** The ETL pipeline fetches and cleans the daily order data for each SKU.
   
2. **Feature Engineering:** Compute time series features and tag SKUs based on data frequency.

3. **Model Training:** For each SKU, run a suite of candidate models on historical data. Use a rolling backtesting approach to compute forecast errors for different horizons.

4. **Model Selection:** Select the best model (or ensemble) per SKU based on recent performance metrics.
   
5. **Forecast Generation:** Generate forecasts for 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, and 60 days ahead, including confidence intervals.
   
6. **Feedback & Self-Correction:** Once actual sales data for the day becomes available, compare forecasts with actuals. Update performance metrics, trigger re-training or model selection as needed, and log any anomalies.
   
7. **Delivery & Integration:**  Publish forecasts through APIs or dashboards for consumption by downstream applications.

Here’s a high‐level blueprint of how you might design the system:


### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Daily Data Collection:**  
  Set up a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to collect daily sales/order data for each SKU.
- **Data Storage:**  
  Store raw and processed time series data in a centralized data warehouse or data lake (e.g., Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, or a relational database) so that it can be easily accessed for model training, evaluation, and forecasting.

- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
  - **Data Cleaning & Normalization:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform any necessary normalization.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Add features and signals. Refer to the Feature Engineering documentation. 
  - **SKU Segmentation:** Identify SKUs with intermittent demand (sparse data) and tag them for specialized treatment (e.g., using Croston’s method).

### 2. **Building Demand Forecasting Model**

- **Library of Forecasting Models:**  
  Build or integrate a set of candidate models.
  - **Classical Time Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMAX, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and Prophet.
  - **Intermittent Demand Models:** Croston’s method or its variants for SKUs with sporadic sales.
  - **Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models:** Gradient boosting models and other regression-based approaches.

- **Model Training & Updating:**  
  - **Initial Training:** Train candidate models using historical data.
  - **Rolling Window Training:** Use a rolling window or expanding window approach to retrain models daily. This ensures that models adapt to recent trends.

### 3. **Selecting the Best Model**

- **Evaluation and Selection Framework:**
  - **Backtesting:** Implement a backtesting mechanism that uses historical holdout data to compute performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) for each candidate model.
  - **Automated Model Selection:** Develop a decision engine that, for each SKU, picks the best-performing model based on recent error metrics. This decision engine should also consider forecast horizon performance (1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60 days) since some models may perform better at shorter horizons while others excel in the long term.
  
- **Forecast Generation:**
  - **Multi-Horizon Forecasting:** Once the best model(s) is selected for an SKU, generate forecasts for all required horizons (1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60 days).
  - **Confidence Intervals:** Provide confidence intervals with each forecast to quantify uncertainty, which can be useful for downstream decision-making.

### 4. **Automation**

- **Daily Scheduling and Orchestration:**
  - Use orchestration tools like Apache Airflow to schedule the entire pipeline. This includes data ingestion, model retraining, model selection, forecast generation, and reporting.
  
- **Feedback Loop and Self-Correction:**
  - **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor forecast performance by comparing predicted values with actual demand as it becomes available.
  - **Automated Re-training:** Trigger re-training or model re-selection when performance degrades. For example, if the error metrics for a chosen model exceed a threshold, the system can automatically re-run the model selection process using the latest data.
  - **Adaptive Learning:** Incorporate a feedback mechanism where forecast errors are logged and used as additional input for model recalibration, making the system “self-correcting” over time.

- **Logging and Alerting:**
  - Set up dashboards and alerts to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for the forecasting system. This helps identify anomalies, model drifts, or data issues early.

### 5. **Scaling Infrastructure** (If necessary)

- **Microservices Architecture:**
  - **Service Separation:** Break down the system into microservices (data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, forecasting, evaluation, etc.) to allow independent scaling and easier maintenance.
  - **Containerization:** Use Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to deploy and manage these services, ensuring the system can scale horizontally as the number of SKUs grows.

- **Distributed Computing:**
  - Leverage distributed computing frameworks (like Apache Spark or Dask) if data volumes are high, ensuring that model training and forecast generation remain performant.

- **API Layer:**
  - Expose forecasts via APIs so that other systems (inventory management, replenishment systems, dashboards) can easily consume the forecasts.
