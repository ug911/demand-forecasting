# Demand Forecasting Project

This repository contains a suite of tools and models designed for demand forecasting, catering to various scenarios including intermittent demand and providing confidence intervals for predictions. The project is structured to be modular, allowing for easy experimentation with different forecasting techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   **`forecasted_data/`**: This directory is intended to store the output of the forecasting models, such as CSV files containing predicted values.
*   **`model_files/`**: This directory can be used to store trained model artifacts (e.g., pickled models, saved weights), allowing for easy loading and reuse of trained models without retraining.
*   **`sample_data/`**: Contains example datasets used for testing and development.
*   **`DemandForecaster.py`**: This is likely the main entry point or a core module containing the overall logic for demand forecasting, potentially orchestrating the use of other modules.
*   **`FeatureEngineering.md`**: Contains documentation or code related to feature engineering techniques used to prepare data for the forecasting models.
*   **Forecasting Model Scripts**: These scripts implement various forecasting models:
    *   **`forecasting_gradiant_boosting_models.py`**: Implements forecasting using Gradient Boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).
    *   **`forecasting_intermittent_demand_skus.py`**: Contains specialized logic for handling intermittent demand, where demand occurs sporadically.
    *   **`forecasting_monte_carlo_simulations.py`**: Implements forecasting using Monte Carlo simulations, useful for generating probabilistic forecasts.
    *   **`forecasting_prophet_model.py`**: Implements forecasting using the Prophet model, designed for time series with strong seasonality.
    *   **`forecasting_sarimax_model.py`**: Implements forecasting using the SARIMAX model, a powerful statistical model for time series data.
    *   **`forecasting_with_confidence_intervals.py`**: Contains functions or logic for calculating and presenting confidence intervals for the forecasts.
*   **Model Explanation Documents**: These Markdown files provide detailed explanations of the implemented models:
    *   **`ModelExplanation_ConfidenceIntervals.md`**: Explains the methodology used for calculating confidence intervals.
    *   **`ModelExplanation_GradiantBoosting.md`**: Explains the theory and application of Gradient Boosting models in this context.
    *   **`ModelExplanation_MonteCarlo.md`**: Explains the application of Monte Carlo simulations for forecasting.
    *   **`ModelExplanation_Prophet.md`**: Provides details about the Prophet model and its parameters.
    *   **`ModelExplanation_SARIMAX.md`**: Explains the SARIMAX model and its components.
*   **`ForecastingModels.md`**: A summary document detailing the different forecasting models implemented in the project and their appropriate use cases.
*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Features
